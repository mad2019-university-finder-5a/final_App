    <p style="color:#00004d;padding-right:10px;padding-left:10px;">Over the past couple of decades, Australia has been witness to increasing numbers of
        international students coming in for higher studies. This has been a part of a larger,worldwide
        phenomenon of students going to foreign countries to pursue higher education.
        This population of expat international students in Australia also forms a major portion of the
        population demanding cultural and traditional foods. International students in Australia,
        especially the ones who have newly arrived from their home countries, would like to eat their
        familiar, traditional cultural foods.</p>
