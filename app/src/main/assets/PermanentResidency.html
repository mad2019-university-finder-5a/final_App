<div class="container">
    <p style="color:#00004d;font-weight: bold;padding-left:8px;padding-right:8px;">
        Many international students studying in Australia stay in the country with the hope that one day they will become permanent residents
        and carry on their stay in Australia for good. However students should remember that General Skilled Migration rules keep changing.
        This is an uncertain path and there is no guarantee to get Permanent residency after Studies in Australia.
