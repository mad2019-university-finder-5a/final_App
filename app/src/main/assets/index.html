<p> Australia is a popular place for foreigners looking to work abroad. If you intend to get a work visa in the country,
    a good starting point is to check out the<a href="https://www.visahunter.com/">Government of Australia’s website</a>
    where they list skill shortages and how to go about finding employment in this country.
    Because Australia is a such a popular place to look for work, a number of bloggers have written useful
    information on the best resources for finding jobs here and how to go about getting the necessary work visas and
    documentation. I’ve compiled these job search resources all into one place right here on this page. Enjoy and Good luck!</p>
